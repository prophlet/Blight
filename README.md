# THE PROJECT WILL NOT COMPILE BY ITSELF. YOU WILL NEED TO EDIT IT TO REMOVE MY MOST RECENT CHANGES, WHICH INVOLVE A FILESERVER SYSTEM. I WILL NOT BE DOING THIS, SINCE I DON'T GIVE A SHIT.

### Blight-Loader

A preformant and modular malware loader designed to handle tons of clients while being stable, and having
an API for easy integration with other forms of control.

### Notice
This project is being abandoned due to lack of funding and general burnout.
Enjoy the source code, allbe it a little bit shitty.

### Features:
- Entire thing is written in rust
- Easy to use web panel
- API for using controlling methods, like discord bots easily
- Webhook notifications
- Infinitley scaleable (with slight modification)
- Support for multiple execution methods
- Very modular (designed to be flexable. you can make it do anything you want, since you can send and recieve anything)
- Very configurable (json file that lets you configurate anything you'd ever want)
- Antispam built in (state of the art antispam system that makes it impossible for a single device to spam the server, a botnet is basically required)
- Blocking of suspicious requests (malformed or suspicious requests are blocked, keeping your server secure)
- Optional IP verification (blocks the connection of vpns, proxies, and antivirus companies' servers)
- Lightweight (Can handle a bunch of clients without using many resources)

# About the server:
The server is very stable and will rarely break. It's also quite secure, and with the max security settings it's nearly impossible to penetrate or break in any way. It's also super modular and you can basically do anything you want with this project. It doesn't HAVE to be a loader, I just use it as one.

# About the client:
The client is not written nearly as well as the server. You'll need to rewrite it yourself in order for it to function well.
