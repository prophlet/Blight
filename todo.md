# Automatic Captcha

- Client sends 8 random bytes to the server, message RSA encrypted.

[ 
    
    SERVER - Generate 8 bytes. Generate every possible combination for those 8 bytes. 
    Pick 2 from every possible combination at random, send one to the client raw, 
    and argon hash the other and send it to the client.
    Combine the other one and the client's bytes, sha256 hash it, and store the hash.

]

- Server responds with 8 bytes and an argon hash, message AES encrypted using the client's 8 random bytes.

[

    CLIENT - Generate every possible combination of the 8 bytes that the server sent.
    For every byte in the generated bytes, combine the client's bytes with the server's bytes and argon hash.
    Continue until the argon hash verifies with the server's argon hash. 
    Once the server's bytes have been discovered, combine the server bytes and client bytes and sha256 hash it.
    
]

- Send a registration request to the server using the sha256 hash as the AES key for the message.
- If the server's sha256 hash matches the client's sha256 hash, continue. If there is a mismatch, block the client.
